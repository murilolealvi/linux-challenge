# Linux Challenge


I will partition my progress on the [challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org) for the proposed 20 days.

The ideia is to refine my Linux skills and learn new topics.
Along with this training, I'm reading  [How Linux Works](https://www.amazon.com/How-Linux-Works-Brian-Ward/dp/1718500408).

Let's get into some fun!
