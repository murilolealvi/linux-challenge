# The journey has not ended

Linux challenge was great. Why does it need to end?
We leverage the concepts and start to learn for LPIC1 certification!
The plan is:
- How Linux Works book as the source of the truth
- [Jadi playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKkNUvEHXhk&list=PLFOYXCPEqdNUU55Xvgst8wGTWnz_sd-cj) to get it visual with a teacher
- LPIC official lessons to get the feeling for the actual exam
