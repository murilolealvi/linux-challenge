# Find system files and place files in the correct location

Let's overview the filesystem tree structure under Linux:


- /: root directory
- /bin: binaries
- /boot: initrd and kernel in order to boot
- /dev: device files
- /etc: configuration files
- /home: user and/or root files (could be under /root)
- /lib: shared libraries
- /media: user-mountable media (USB drive)
- /mnt: mount point for temporary mounted filesystems
- /opt: application software packages
- /run: run-time variable data
- /sbin: system binaries (must be superuser/root)
- /srv: data served by the system
- /tmp: temporary files
- /usr: read-only user data
- /proc: virtual filesystem for running processes info
- /var: variabla data written during system operation (log data, print queue, mailboxes, browser cache, etc.)
